## [Bayesian Coin Tossing](https://github.com/sob-ANN/Projects/blob/main/Bayesian/Coin%20Tossing%20(Probabilistic).ipynb)
A simple coin tossing example modelled using Bayesian Statistics implemented in Pymc3. Posterior is approximated using the No U-Turn Sampling (NUTS) and the traces are plotted using ArviZ. Further, multiple plots help visualize the Binomial distribution with different parameters.
