## [Deep-O-Net](https://github.com/sob-ANN/Projects/blob/main/Operator%20Learning/Deep_o_net_Final.ipynb)
Here we dive into Operator Learning. Deep-O-Net has been implemented using Pytorch. Data is generated in the same way as was done in the paper(https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03193) for the Antiderivative operator.
## [Fourier Neural Operator](https://github.com/sob-ANN/Projects/blob/main/Operator%20Learning/Fourier%20Neural%20operator.ipynb)
Applying a Fourier Neural Operator on 1d Burgers' Equation as discussed in the paper (https://scholar.google.com/scholar_lookup?arxiv_id=2010.08895)
