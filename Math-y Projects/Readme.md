## [Advection Diffusion](https://github.com/sob-ANN/Project/blob/main/Math-y%Projects/Advection-Diffusion%20Equation%20on%20real%20world%20data.ipynb) 
Solution of the Advection Diffusion PDE on real world wind data using different values of "Peclet Number".
## [Image Convolution using Matrices](https://github.com/sob-ANN/APL703/blob/main/Image%20Convolution%20using%20Matrices.ipynb)
Various filters applied to images are merely Matrix operations (Convolution Operation). Many of these 'filters' have been applied to images in this project by Convolution.
## [Partial Differential Equation](https://github.com/sob-ANN/APL703/blob/main/Partial%20Differential%20Equation%20Solution%2C%20Visualization.ipynb)
A PDE with Direchlet Boundary Conditions has been solved and the results have been plotted. This gives a nice visualisation of the solution space and helps understand and interpret the results better.
## [Projectile Motion Using odeint](https://github.com/sob-ANN/APL703/blob/main/Projectile%20Motion%20using%20odeint.ipynb)
Scipy has a neat way of solving Differential Equations using the library 'odeint'. Using that, we plot the motion of a football (projectile) kicked from the ground with  drag force acting on it. Values of different parameters have been taken to be as close to the real values as possible.
