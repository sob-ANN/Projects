## Data Science Related

- ## Data-Driven Fantasy Premier League (FPL) Team Selection

In the world of Fantasy Premier League (FPL), where over 10 million football fans compete annually, data-driven decisions can make all the difference. In this project, I harnessed data from the FPL website using an API call to gain a competitive edge in team selection. Here's what I explored:

- **Metrics for Player Selection**: I created custom metrics such as 'Value' (points scored/cost) to identify cost-effective players. Additionally, I delved into Expected Goals (xG) and Expected Assists (xA) to uncover players who outperformed their xG, offering insights into potential overperformers and underperformers.

- **Beyond the Numbers**: While data is essential, sometimes players can defy statistical expectations. I delved into the fascinating world of "looking beyond the underlying numbers" to evaluate player performance beyond mere statistics. 

- **Optimal Team Building**: I attempted to find the 'most optimal' FPL team while navigating constraints such as budget limitations, maximum/minimum players per position, and team quotas. This project was my first step in using data to optimize team selection.

I plan to extend this project in the future to include in-season changes and predictions. Historical data may also play a crucial role in making informed decisions. This was my initial attempt to apply my learning and passion for FPL in a data-driven manner.

## Sentiment Analysis with RNN and LSTM

## Neural Network with TensorFlow

Explore the fundamentals of Neural Networks with this basic implementation using TensorFlow. I applied this model to the MNIST dataset to understand the representations learned by hidden layers while mastering TensorFlow's API.

## Support Vector Machine

Dive into the world of classification with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, implemented using the sklearn library. This project explores various kernel functions, including radial basis function (rbf) and polynomial kernels, with extensive hyperparameter tuning to achieve high accuracy. You can also check out a Kaggle competition where my model achieved an impressive accuracy of 0.98 ([Kaggle Competition Link](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ell-784-assignment-2/leaderboard)).

## K-means Clustering

Uncover patterns in data with the K-means Clustering algorithm. This unsupervised clustering model was applied to the MNIST dataset using sklearn. I experimented with different values of 'k' (number of clusters) to understand how it impacts prediction accuracy.
